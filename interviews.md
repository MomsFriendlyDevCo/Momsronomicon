Alternate title for this section: "How to tell if a potential developer really knows what he is doing".
This section is intended as a rough guide to the dev skills we are looking for.

You may also find the [Starter projects](getting-started.md) section useful as it also provides some sample projects to give to potential employees.


Job description
---------------
A general use job description suitable for web-devs.

	Due to an upswing in projects we are seeking a coder with light to
	expert level experience of NodeJS and/or front-end frameworks
	(specifically ExpressJS and AngularJS frameworks respectively). Other
	skills such as database knowledge or general *nix experience are desirable
	but non-essential if the candidate is willing to learn new skills.


	Essential skill set:
	* Intermediate written English skills
	* NodeJS programming experience OR front-end JavaScript in general
	* Basic experience with MVC systems or other structured framework models
	* HTML, CSS and JavaScript experience
	* Front-end framework knowledge - jQuery, Angular, Ember, Backbone or similar


	Desirable skills:
	* Ability to both write new code and maintain existing code-bases using a source control system - specifically Git
	* Some experience of a back-end MVC framework - e.g. ExpressJS, Sails, CodeIgniter CakePHP, Laravel or equivalent 
	* Some database knowledge - Mongo, MySQL, Redis or similar
	* Experience of a frontend design framework (ideally Bootstrap)
	* Experience of a frontend framework stack (ideally Angular)
	* Experience with HTML5 + mobile app frameworks - e.g. jQuery Mobile, Sencha, Ratchet etc.
	* *nix knowledge is considered a definite plus
	* Familiarity with inline documentation systems - specicially JSDoc, PHPDoc
	* General networking knowledge
	* Extra skills that may be useful: BASH coding, general *nix console usage


Past projects

If the sites he references are pretty professional and well done - you need to ask him:

* What he has specifically contributed
* What framework was used with the sites
* Whether he has any opinions on it or other frameworks
* Ask for positive and negative points on the framework. Pay particular attention to negatives since this shows he has some compatible experience in other areas.


PHP Specific
------------
The key point with PHP is that the language is pretty much a sloppy mess and anything developed professionally needs a decent framework to prop it up so you can hand a project off to someone else to maintain.

The following phrases should set off alarms:

* "We don't believe in frameworks or don't use them" - Everyone is entitled to their opinion of course but this is where unmaintainable messes of code happen. If he can justify his decisions then thats ok, if not it is a good warning he hasn't looked beyond his own skill set.
* "I use my own framework" - This suggests someone who is at least proficient in the language but in the long run gives you even more of the problems associated than using a popular but lesser framework. Imagine someone saying "Well I wrote the book you wanted but did it in my own never-documented version of Gaelic. Now I'm leaving - good luck". As with the above, if a justification can be given then thats fine.
* "I do SEO" - SEO is to programming what HTML is to code - its not. This is only said by people who understand neither. If he has it listed on his CV as a sidenote then all is well. If he makes a big deal about it or it forms the central part of his skills - you may have a problem.


Instant aptitude questions - just add cynicism
----------------------------------------------
If the interviewee answers 'yes' to any of the following questions, don't bother to continue the interview:

* Do you think JavaScript and jQuery are the same thing?
* Have you ever named a function starting with "my", or your own name?
* Do you think VCS commit messages are optional?
* Have you ever written try/catch with an empty catch block?
* Have you ever written a CMS entirely with PL/SQL?
* Have you obtained a Microsoft Certification and if so did you pay for it yourself?

Other useful questions or interview techniques can be found in [Further reading](futher-reading.md).
