Alternate title for this section: "How to tell if a potential developer really knows what he is doing".
This section is intended as a rough guide to the dev skills we are looking for.


Job description
---------------
A general use job description suitable for web-devs.

```
Due to an upswing in projects we are seeking a coder with light to
expert level experience of NodeJS and/or front-end frameworks
(specifically Vue, AngularJS and ExpressJS frameworks respectively). Other
skills such as database knowledge or general *nix experience are desirable
but non-essential if the candidate is willing to learn new skills.


Essential skill set:
* Intermediate written English skills
* NodeJS programming experience OR front-end JavaScript in general
* Basic experience with MVC systems or other structured framework models
* HTML, CSS and JavaScript experience
* Front-end framework knowledge - jQuery, Angular, Vue, Ember, Backbone or similar


Desirable skills:
* Ability to both write new code and maintain existing code-bases using a source control system - specifically Git
* Some experience of a back-end MVC framework - e.g. ExpressJS, Sails, CodeIgniter CakePHP, Laravel or equivalent
* Some database knowledge - Mongo, MySQL, Redis or similar
* Experience of a frontend design framework (ideally Bootstrap)
* Experience of a frontend framework stack (ideally Angular and/or Vue)
* Experience with HTML5 + mobile app frameworks - e.g. jQuery Mobile, Sencha, Ratchet, Cordova etc.
* *nix knowledge is considered a definite plus
* Familiarity with inline documentation systems - specicially JSDoc, PHPDoc
* General networking knowledge
* Extra skills that may be useful: BASH coding, general *nix console usage
```

If the sites (s)he references are pretty professional and well done - you need to ask him / her:

* What (s)he has specifically contributed
* What framework was used with the sites
* Whether (s)he has any opinions on it or other frameworks
* Ask for positive and negative points on the framework. Pay particular attention to negatives since this shows (s)he has some compatible experience in other areas.


General Alarms
--------------
The following phrases should set off alarms:

* "We don't believe in frameworks or don't use them" - Everyone is entitled to their opinion of course but this is where unmaintainable messes of code happen. If (s)he can justify his decisions then thats ok, if not it is a good warning (s)he hasn't looked beyond his own skill set.
* "I use my own framework" - This suggests someone who is at least proficient in the language but in the long run gives you even more of the problems associated than using a popular but lesser framework. Imagine someone saying "Well I wrote the book you wanted but did it in my own never-documented version of Gaelic. Now I'm leaving - good luck". As with the above, if a justification can be given then thats fine.
* "I do SEO" - SEO is to programming what HTML is to code - its not. This is only said by people who understand neither. If (s)he has it listed on his CV as a sidenote then all is well. If (s)he makes a big deal about it or it forms the central part of his skills - you may have a problem.


If the interviewee answers 'yes' to any of the following questions, it might not be a good idea to continue the interview (all of these are examples of prior interviews):

* Do you think JavaScript and jQuery are the same thing?
* How do you approch versioning system commit messages?
* How to do you approch error catching within a project?
* Have you ever written a CMS entirely with PL/SQL?
* Have you obtained a Microsoft Certification and if so did you pay for it yourself?
