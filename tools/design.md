Design tools
============
We have generally found [Balsamiq mockups](http://balsamiq.com) to be the go-to prototyping system as it provides an excellent user interface capable of generating UI's with little overhead.

For ERD diagrams [LucidChart](http://www.lucidchart.com) is the best option we have found so far.

Everything else should be constrained to standard office tools - MS Office / LibreOffice etc.
