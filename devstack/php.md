PHP Dev Stack
=============
**NOTE:** We are moving _away_ from PHP for all future projects. See the [NodeJS Dev Stack](node.md) section for current practicles. This section is left here for reference.

The PHP Dev stack uses the following:

* Linux based web-hosting using Apache
* HTML, CSS and JavaScript - the basics of web-page creation
* [jQuery](http://jquery.com) - With optional plugins
* [AngularJS](http://angularjs.org) - Frontend JS framework
* [PHP](http://php.net) - Server side language
* [CodeIgniter](http://codeigniter.com/user_guide) - An MVC framework for PHP
* Git / [GitHub](https://github.com) - For project management

Don't worry about most of the above if you've not come across them before. The largest hurdle will be picking up CodeIgniter first.

[CodeIgniter](http://codeigniter.com/user_guide) is an [MVC framework](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller) for PHP.
PHP is a programming language that, as you may already know, can quickly get out of hand when projects grow to anything more than one page websites. PHP is not alone in this, most higher level languages (HLLs) usually have the language as a baseline then add a framework to implement a specific function. For example Perl is a programing language Mason is its framework for generating web pages. JavaScript/NodeJS is a language, Express is the framework for web apps etc.

MVC tries to tidy up development by implementing what is known as the [Principle of Least Astonishment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_least_astonishment). The aim of this is when you look at someone else's project or someone looks at yours - regardless of however many hundreds of files you have comprising that project - it should be possible to immediately jump to the function, page or construct that you are looking for.

What I would suggest is to have a read though the [CodeIgniter site](http://codeigniter.com/user_guide). Its generally written in a user friendly way with good [Starter material and videos](http://codeigniter.com/tutorials/). After you think you've got a grip on how everything works try putting together a simple project that involves a few different conceptual entities.

More about PHP and CodeIgniter can be found in the [CodeIgniter projects](../style/php.md) section.
