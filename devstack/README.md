Development stack
=================
Here at Mom's there are two major project 'flavours': PHP and NodeJS.

[NodeJS](node.md) is the current preferred backend of project development envrionment at Moms. The temptation is to assume that since NodeJS is JavaScript it must behave exactly the same as regular browser JavaScript - this is not true, there are quite a few major differences. Because of this we treat frontend (i.e. what the browser does, see below) and backend (i.e. what the server does) as two entirely different programming environments.

[AngularJS](https://angularjs.org) is the older version of Angular (also known as Angular version 1). This is largely only in use for some of our legacy projects and is now somewhat out os style.

[VueJS](https://vuejs.org) is our current frontend environment and could be described as the product of AngularJS + React.

See [Doop](https://github.com/MomsFriendlyDevCo/Doop) for the full MFDC deployment environment which incorporates NodeJS + VueJS.
