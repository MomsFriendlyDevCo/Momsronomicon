Productivity Tips
=================
> More effort does not equal more effect

Following tips are heavily inspired from [Edmond Lau's 2015 Google Talk on "The Effective Engineer"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BnIz7H5ruy0).

1. **Optimise for learning**
	* In order to 'keep pace' with the IT industry it is crucial you make a good habit of learning and being able to process new information, which may supersede old knowledge.
	* Learning can be an exponential, compound experience IF you make it that way.
	* Dedicate portions of your day / week to learning / self-teaching.

2. **Invest in iteration speed**
	* Iteration speed refers to how quickly you can get things done.
	* Use appropriate tooling to help you get the job done faster and with less error.
	* If a tool you use stops being useful or conducive to improved iteration speed, find a new tool.

3. **Validate your ideas aggressively and iteratively**
	* Do this with simple, testable hypotheses.
	* Validating ideas -- whether at a high or low level in the product or project -- can save you a lot of pain down the track. You may have a fantastic, performant feature or product, but if no one wants it or uses it, could your effort and time have been channelled into something more fruitful?

4. **Minimise operational burden**
	* A common problem is that we spend so much time maintaining our software that we don't really have time to build new things.
	* *"Do the simple thing first"*.
	* Minimise sources of complexity: every feature or system you add is another potential fire you may have to put out down the track.
	* Typical sources of complexity:
		* Code --- e.g., Is the code clearly written and appropriately documented?
		* System --- e.g., How tightly-coupled are the modules/components within the system?
		* Product -- e.g., How many features is the product supposed to support?
		* Organisational --- e.g., What is the process to design/develop/test; how does the team communicate and manage tasks?

5. **Contribute toward building and maintaining a great engineering culture**
	* Places that optimise for learning, utilise good tooling, and focus on high-leverage activities result in teams that are more productive and satisfied with the EFFORT they put in versus the EFFECT they get out.
	* Leverage: the central, guiding metric that effective engineers use to determine where and how to spend their time.
	* How you can expect to deliver an effective product without an effective team behind it?
