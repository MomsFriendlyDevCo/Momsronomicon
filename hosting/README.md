Hosting
-------
There are a couple of variations with hosting:

1. **cPanel** - Largely legacy now due to it not really being updated in the last 5 years. Cheap and common hosting option.
2. **VPS** - Virtual Private servers. These require a lot of maintenance but provide the best value.
	1. [DigitalOcean / BinaryLane / VMs](vms.md) is used mostly by MFDC for server deployments
	2. [Hosting Node Environments](node.md)
3. **App hosting** - Similar to VPS's but managed centrally, these expose an app platform allowing simpler deployments
