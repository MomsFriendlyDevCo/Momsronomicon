Testing at MFDC
---------------
The temptation to forego testing always seems to loom in our minds, despite our conscience probably telling us otherwise. In any case, it goes without saying that software testing is crucial and increasingly so with the more complex a system becomes.

As a developer, you may be required to conduct and/or write a variety of tests for any feature within a system. The types of testing a developer or BA may be required to conduct include, but are not limited to, the following:

* **Compatibility testing** - Does the software function correctly on the platforms we said it would?
* **Regression testing** - Did a change in the code introduce a defect in the software?
* **Destructive testing** - How robust is the software?
* **Security testing** - To what degree can the software protect information from unauthorised access?
* **Usability testing** - How easy to use is the software?

These tests may need to be performed both on the unit and system level.
