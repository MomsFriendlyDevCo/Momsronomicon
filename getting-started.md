Starter projects
================
A frequently asked question is for an example project which allows the newbie programmer to quickly explore a new environment.

Some ideas (listed beginner to advanced):

* **FizzBuzz (beginner level)** - [Fizzbuzz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fizzbuzz) is a standard beginner-level programmer test. Generally a potential programmer should be given a whiteboard marker and asked to plot out how to solve the FizzBuzz test - "Output the numbers 1 to 100, every 3 numbers output 'Fizz', every 5 output 'Buzz' if the number is both 3 and 5 output 'Fizz Buzz'".

* **Twitter (basic level)** - A Twitter clone tends to be simple enough not to get too frustrating but involve enough objects (users, posts, tags) to keep it interesting. Start with a simple project that views individual tweets, after that look into implementing a user login system (next point) or tagging system.

* **Login system (mid level)** - Since a login system includes the need for a database, controllers to manage the process and models to manage the data a login system provides a end-to-end example project which should encompass all elements of a project.

* **User management system (higher level)** - Building off the above idea of a login system is the extended concept of an admin managing user accounts. This includes the ability to list, edit, create and delete accounts as per the CRUD / BREAD methodologies listed below.
