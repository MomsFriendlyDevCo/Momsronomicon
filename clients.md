A handy reference for types of clients.


**The Hoopbringer**

These types of clients are generally smaller single person entities that have had an idea but haven't really thought though the ramifications. Mostly unmotivated to do anything other than talk about their idea, they normally cause more work for the company to pursue than they are worth.

Counteracted by identifying timelines and budgets in order to determine if there is an actual project. Suggesting a paid period of initial consultation (even if the money is minor) is a good barrier to determine if the client is serious.


**The Helicopter**

Named for clients who hover around and oversee your every move. To be avoided for obvious reasons as the majority of the project turns into meetings about progress rather than actually achieving any.

A variation on the Helicopter client is one where he or a member of the company *thinks* they have some experience with an aspect of the project - PM, BA, design or programming. This can quickly get out of hand as MFDC works better as a tight-knit company rather than having to outsource one aspect of the project to a client for one aspect of the process.

Counteracted by 'distracting' with smaller aspects of the project and trying to keep as much distance as possible. e.g. if the client wishes to concentrate on design provide him with Visio / Balsamiq (or a pack of crayons) and let him design away like mad while quietly working on your UI which (hopefully) will be more professional anyway. If this is not the case a quick round of focus testing usually points out the flaws and is useful for deflecting accusations to your own person. If the client *has* come up with something better then obviously use that, the company is not always right.


**Share options only**

Also known as *The Broke Client*.

Sometimes a client may not have any money to pay for development up front and/or have any means to do so in the immediate future. Sometimes this is acceptable if the project is worthwhile but generally this can lead to trouble.

Oddly in our experience the more humble the renumeration the more demanding the client so some means of compensation should at least be sought at any one time.

Should the sentence "we can pay you guys as soon as it starts making money" be said a klaxon should sound and the client be ejected from the premises.

This type of client should not be confused with a client which *has* money but refuses to pay for a milestone.


**Best friend clients**

Ideas can of course spring from inspiration all around us, so its inevitable that sometimes ideas may come from family, friends or others that have a close relationship to us.

While some of these projects can be genuinely tempting special bias must be placed on the awkwardness of working with personal contacts unless some degree of compartmentalization can be afforded.

Best friends clients can warp our sense of priority - usually making us over-value tiny changes in order to impress or justify our relationships. Additionally there is a strong temptation to reduce or forgo payment on a project all together because of friendship - this is to be avoided at all costs. The exchange of money, however minor, can cement the understanding that a project is at the professional level. *Never* do family or friend projects without *some* compensation or the immediate plans to obtain it.
